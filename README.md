# pmp-client-cli

Archived, given that C++ is not the correct tool for this project.

This is a personal password manager project. The long term goal for this project is to be able to generate complex passwords using a CLI client on Windows/MacOS/Linux, and store/retrieve it between different devices.

Proof of concept. Not ready for real world use.
